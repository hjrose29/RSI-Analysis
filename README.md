Intro:
        The stock market and finances are strong interests of mine. For example, at the time of me writing this I am currently occupied by a Financial Services Winter Internship where I further my analytical skills. I am also on the Executive Board of my schools, investment club as a Sector Leader with my sector managing over 20% the club’s capital which exceeds 600,000 real dollars. 

     With this, I decided to pair my interest in finances with my love for Data Science. Recently, I have been intrigued by a strategy based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for trading. As the name suggests the RSI provides information to the trader regarding the stock’s standing as either overbought or oversold. If the RSI is below 50, we can say that the RSI would suggest the stock to be relatively oversold meaning it might be a good time to buy. Likewise, if the RSI is above 50, we can say that the RSI would suggest the stock to be relatively overbought and it might be a good time to sell.

Implementation:
         We can implement this in trading in many ways. This project uses the RSI in the following way: If the RSI is below 30, the script will buy as many shares as we can afford once the RSI crosses over 30. If the RSI is above 70, the script will sell as many shares as we have once the RSI crosses back below 70. The script will do so for the given period on the interval of 1 Day over the past year in the Jupyter Notebook seen below, however, that is easily modified.
